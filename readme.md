# Conversational UX with RxFx

An example app of how RxFx can enable simpler building of Conversational UX apps, using the style of ChatGPT, and featuring streaming, cancelation, and activity detection, building mostly in the React-Free Zone.

## Branches:

- `demo-start` - An empty app shell with TODO comments
- `demo-finish` - Where you could end up.

## Steps to build:

1. Basic request/streaming response/state working
2. Include previous message history
3. Add Working/Loading states
4. Support Cancelation
5. Block while answering
6. Adjust timing of printed chunks for realism (bonus!)
